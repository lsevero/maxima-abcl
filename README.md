# maxima-abcl

Compiled Maxima binaries for ABCL.

Created mainly for [clj-maxima](https://github.com/lsevero/clj-maxima), but can be used standalone with abcl.jar.

This repo does not provide the Maxima source code, which is hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/ .

All credits for the Maxima development team.
